# Changelog
### Master

* Don't pull in spark or just-i18n dependencies, neither are directly needed anymore. [fc994c1](https://github.com/BeDifferential/accounts-entry/commit/fc994c1afe10dfcbb54b7aae2b0cf9fc5ba1f5b6)
* Add name attributes on signUp form to be consistent [#107](https://github.com/BeDifferential/accounts-entry/pull/107)
